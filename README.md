# Final-task
### The goal of the project is to create an application for e-commerce.

It's a comprehensive online shopping portal that provides an interactive and seamless experience to users. From product discovery to checkout, the application ensures a smooth journey for the user, enhancing their engagement and boosting their purchasing confidence.

Users can browse through a vast range of products, view detailed descriptions, add their favorite items to the basket, and proceed to checkout. It includes features such as user registration and login, product search, product categorization, convenient shopping cart, and sorting to make the shopping experience more streamlined and convenient.

An important aspect of our application is that it's responsive, ensuring it looks great on various devices with a minimum resolution of 390px. This feature makes the shopping experience enjoyable, irrespective of the device users prefer.

### To implement the project we use:
`Jira` - for managing the work of the team and tracking our work.<br>
`Commercetools` - is a cloud-based headless commerce platform that provides APIs to power e-commerce sales.<br>
`React` - a library for developing user interfaces and creating a unified code structure.<br>
`TypeScript` - for strict typing.<br>
`Jest` - for testing code.<br>
`Tailwind` - to quickly design a website using simple building blocks.<br>
We use `webpack` to build the project.<br>
We also use `Eslint` and `prettier` for a unified code style.<br>
`Github` to store the code base, and we also use `husky` hooks to prevent bad code from getting into the repository.
